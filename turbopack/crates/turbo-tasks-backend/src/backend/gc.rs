//! Garbage collection for the persistent backend.
//!
//! GC removes tasks that have become unreachable from the live task graph (their persistent
//! `parent_count` reached 0) from both memory and the on-disk cache. The pass runs under the
//! coordinator's GC phase (see
//! [`SnapshotCoordinator::begin_gc`](crate::backend::snapshot_coordinator)) — which excludes normal
//! operations — and is driven as a fully parallel, unbounded job pool
//! (see [`TurboTasksBackend::gc_collect`]).
//!
//! This module holds the GC-specific logic (the job types, the pool driver, per-job teardown, and
//! the pin/unpin bookkeeping) as an `impl TurboTasksBackend`; it is a child of the `backend` module
//! so it reaches the backend's private state (`storage`, `snapshot_coord`) and the GC-only
//! `execute_context_gc` directly. Callers (`snapshot_and_persist`, `stop`, the background job loop,
//! the `Backend` trait's `pin_task_for_gc`/`unpin_task_for_gc`) live in `mod.rs`.

    /// Why this is safe to run concurrently under the GC phase (which excludes normal operations
    /// but not the GC jobs from each other):
    /// - Each job builds its own [`ExecuteContext`] (`execute_context_gc`); the concurrent-lock
    ///   detector is per-context, so jobs on different threads holding different task guards do not
    ///   false-positive.
    /// - The storage map is a sharded dashmap: different tasks hit different shards; same-task
    ///   access is serialized by the shard lock.
    /// - The cascade decrement (`update_and_get_parent_count(-1)`) is a read-modify-write under the
    ///   child's entry write lock, so if two collected parents decrement the same child
    ///   concurrently, exactly one observes the count hit 0 and spawns its collect — no
    ///   double-collect, no lost decrement.
    /// - A collectible task has `parent_count == 0`, so no *surviving* task lists it as a child: a
    ///   task becomes a collect target only after its last persistent parent was itself collected
    ///   (which removed the edge). So a `Collect` never races a decrement of the same task and
    ///   never `ctx.task`-resurrects a task another job just removed.
    /// - Per-job results merge into shared accumulators guarded by a mutex/atomic, touched only on
    ///   the rare collect/retain outcome (not per decrement or per scrub), so they are not a
    ///   contention hot spot.
    ///
    /// `scope_unbounded` runs jobs on the runtime worker threads plus the calling thread, which
    /// drains the whole (growing) pool itself if no helper is scheduled — so this does not depend
